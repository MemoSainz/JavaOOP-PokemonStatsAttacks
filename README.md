## A mini terminal-game of pokemon 

<h2> Java Object-oriented programming </h2>

It's a project in the terminal where the user is able to select a pokemon and see their stats as well their common attacks.

In the project it was used both Interfaces and Abstract Classes.
With each of their constructors.
As well, While loop was present among Switch statements.

With the scanner class, the user can insert in the termina which pokemon desires to see their stats and attacks.
The process of the terminal will end when the user inserts an 'exit' there.
